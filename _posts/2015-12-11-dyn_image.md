_this is an old blog post from my previous blog_

Who doesn't love a cool forum signature? How about one that changes everytime you refresh the page?

The first time I came into *contact* with dynamic images was when I saw this *[text](http://tech.reboot.pro/dyn.php)* on the popular mobile forum [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/); and it didn't take me long to trace it back to this guy here; [AceInfinity](http://tech.reboot.pro/member.php?action=profile&uid=1). Inevitably, it found a way into my signature; and stayed there for a very long time.

Days rolled by; and I eventually *almost* forgot all about it; but there was a constant little voice at the back of my head reminding how awesome it was and the only thing that I remembered was that it was written in PHP.

I had no idea about PHP, but after 'quickly' making a project for an exhibition; I had a little idea about how PHP works.

So, quickly decided to come back and write one such piece of code myself. Quickly found my way to the [imagecreate](http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreate.php) functions, and as a result, **dyn_image**!

You can find a live example [here](http://php.thewisenerd.changeip.org/dyn_image/).

I wanted it to be truly 'useful' so, I added support for parameters, and support for reading text from external sources (currently, [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/)).

parameters:

   *   ```?id=``` pastebin id
   *   ```?text=``` fallback text
   *   ```?size=``` font size (1 - 5)
   *   ```?align=``` left|center|right
   *   ```?type=``` jpeg|gif|png|webp(experimental)
   *   ```?color=``` html color hex in argb
   *   ```?bg_color=``` html color hex in argb (or) transparent

    raw text delimiters:
   *   ```\r\n```: end of string1
   *   ```\n```: new line
   *   ```\a```: author

you can find an example of text here: http://pastebin.com/FeLudYh4

The above text is what I'm using over at [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4869275) in my forum signature; with the following options:

* ```?id=FeLudYh4```
* ```?type=png```
* ```?size=2```
* ```?align=left```
* ```?color=0064ff```
* ```?bg_color=transparent```

What's more? Since I support open-source (a lot, usually); you can even find its source ([here](https://github.com/thewisenerd/myphp/blob/master/dyn_image/index.php)), and hack it up the way you want it to work!

That's me signing off; after trying to write *documentation* for the stupid things I sometimes write.
