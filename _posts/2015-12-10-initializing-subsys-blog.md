hello, friend.

This is not going to be some long post that explains my life story, or about
when or why I started to write a blog.

I'm not that good at writing either; so, be warned.

Au contraire, it's going to be relatively short. Very, in fact.

thanks to a beautiful theme theme by @jacobtomlinson for his beautiful theme
[carte-noire][1].

there's no google analytics (I'm not sure how or why I need that set up).

There'll not be much* cookie tracking, fret not.

*_The comments system that I use [Disqus], however, do have their own set of cookies._

I can't and won't be able to notify your email everytime I post something; and
I definitely wouldn't want to be the one cluttering up your inbox.

_You may however, get [__RSS__][3]._

this post will end shortly, as I said earlier; so, let's get started.

> I don't want to survive. I want to live.
