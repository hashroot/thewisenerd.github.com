Calvin is better at putting into words my feelings for the _new_ year.

The difference between ```i++``` and ```i = i + 1``` ?

[Kristopher Johnson](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1175/kristopher-johnson)
explains about this in a post written [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/867705/2873157).

> ```i=i+1``` will have to load the value of ```i```, add one to it, and then store the
result back to ```i```. In contrast, ```++i``` may simply increment the value using a
single assembly instruction, so in theory it could be more efficient.

> However, most compilers will optimize away the difference,
and the generated code will be exactly the same.

_on the same note, is ```1 == 4``` ?_

so, happy **_same old_** year!

_p.s. resolutions???_
