_qcom sd 615(arm64), adreno 405, 2 GB, 16 GB, 13/5 MP, 5" FHD, not expandable_

xiaomi is a pretty decent handset maker, (not) considering they release sources on time
and have _great_ after sales service.

they updated firmware in MIUI 7, which broke the kernel sources they released.
CPUs were being offlined, and not able to be brought back offline once dead.

you will have to flash firmware of miui v6.6.10.0 before flashing a custom ROM.

Moving on, thanks to @dh-harald, @smoki3, @k2wl, @omerjerk (and others I may have missed),
this phone has cm-12.1 and cm13 (_already_).

I make my own builds usually for updated ROM sources, or other spin-offs.
You may find them here.
